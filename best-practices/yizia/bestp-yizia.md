Master the GitHub Flow

Most GitHub projects, open-source or not, expect collaborators to follow the GitHub Flow. All contributions should follow these six steps:

Create a branch. This can be in the main project, but if you don’t have access, you can make a branch in a GitHub fork of the project.

Add commits. The changes you’re proposing should be in isolation with short, clearly written commit messages. (More writing tips here.)

Open a pull request. When you’re ready to formally propose your changes, open a pull request so other collaborators can review and comment.

Discuss and review your code. Actively discuss the changes with collaborators. If needed, push updates to your feature branch — no need to open a new pull request to add them.

Deploy. If everyone agrees your changes look good, deploy your changes. For example, if you’re using Heroku, push your branch to the production server.

Merge. If the deploy went smoothly, merge your changes into the master branch.
